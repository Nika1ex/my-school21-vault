# Testing custom grep utility
This is a sample file for testing various grep functionalities.
The word "example" appears in this file multiple times.
Another example of using grep for searching text.
GREP should not match if case sensitivity is on.
Let's see how our grep implementation performs.

89000000000
89000000001
+79000000002
+79000000003
+7(900)000-00-04 89000000001
+7(900)0000007
+7 (900)0000008
+7 900 000 00 08 89000000001

1. This line has a number: 12345.
2. Special characters: @#$%^&*()!\!"'-+=_`~[]][[^[:[.[=[^]?| are also included here.
3. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Empty lines should be handled properly.

This line contains the word "test" to check case insensitivity.
And this line contains the word "TEST" to ensure it matches regardless of case.

# Comments should be ignored by the grep utility
# This is a comment line that starts with a hash symbol.

End of the test file. 

Another line with the word "grep" to test matching.
A line with no matches at all.
This line contains both test and TEST for thorough testing.

# Additional comments
This file is used to test the grep command's capabilities.
The quick brown fox is a classic example used in text processing.

^\(\+7\|8\)[[:space:]]\?(\?9[0-9]\{2\})\?\(\(-\|[[:space:]]\)\?[0-9]\)\{7\}
